				  Fitbit dominates the wearables market, but can it survive? 
				  Apple Watch is fighting to establish itself as the leader in the wearables market, 
				  while the wearables market is looking to establish itself as a valid area of consumer electronics.
				  <p>
				  <p><strong><em>Vendor Highlights:</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Fitbit'</strong>s 2Q15 results reads as a list of successes: triple-digit year-over-year worldwide volume growth; double-digit year-over-year worldwide revenue and profit growth; expanded partnerships with corporate wellness groups, fashion, and food companies; and increased visibility in the media. Fitbit resonates with customers because it has remained true to its simple value proposition of tracking fitness to encourage healthier lifestyles rather than promising the multi-purpose functionality that most smart watches have sought.</p> 
<p><strong>Apple'</strong>s first appearance in the wearables market finds it in the number 2 position overall, and well within reach of market leader Fitbit. Apple is just getting started with its Watch, having reached just sixteen geographic markets to date and starting agreements with third-party retailers. But what is most important is the continued development of the watchOS platform. At its WWDC in June, Apple announced that the next version of watchOS will allow for native applications, which could have a similar effect that iPhones enjoyed when native apps became available.</p> 
<p><strong>Xiaomi</strong> made a fairly big splash when it entered the wearables market last year with its Mi Band. Since then its growth has been unstoppable in China as the vendor was quick to introduce rock-bottom prices. Xiaomi recently expanded into markets outside China although its limited distribution channels have been a dampening factor on its growth.</p> 
<p><strong>Garmin'</strong>s laser-like focus on fitness devices for "citizen athletes" (runners, cyclists, and swimmers) has been successful so far, though increasing competition from the likes of Fitbit and Xiaomi has led to a reduction in share. Garmin's new ConnectIQ platform may help alleviate some of the pressure as it attempts to offer access to third party applications, data fields, watch faces, and widgets to further customize its wearable devices.</p> 
<p><strong>Samsung</strong> narrowly edged out Huawei and Jawbone to remain among the top 5 vendors during the quarter. The company saw sustained success with the popularity of its Gear S and Gear Fit devices, and hinted at a massively redesigned Gear S2 to be announced next month. Given Samsung's history of making its latest wearable devices compatible only with Samsung's top models and nearly exclusive reliance on Tizen, the company has limited its potential reach. Whether that trend continues with the Gear S2 will bear close observation.</p>

					 Wearables are the next big thing. They will dramatically alter the landscape of society 
					  and business as we know it. 
					  Yet, despite the seemingly limitless opportunity of this emergent technology space, 
					  wearable devices have not yet kicked off with 
					   mainstream users and are limited mostly to early adopters, 
					while businesses and technologists are struggling to make sense of it. 

					 About 20% of American adults own a wearable device, but issues such as price, privacy, security, 
					 lack of actionable data, and inconsistent data from such devices continue to 
					 thwart greater adoption. 

					 One-third of American consumers who have owned a wearable product stopped using it within six months, 
					 half of those with an activity tracker no longer use it. 

					 <p>What makes creating successful wearable products so difficult? 
					 How to keep users attached? 
					 What about health risks to the people wearing devices? 
					 How to address the security & privacy concerns?
                     What's the general trend for incorporating the wearable devices into IoT ecosystem?
<br>
Our speakers will provide an overview of the current wearable landscape and 
their insights from the above perspectives.
